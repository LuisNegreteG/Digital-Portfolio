# 📊 RFM Customer Segmentation with Clustering

## 📄 Project Overview
This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to customer transaction data and uses **unsupervised clustering** to segment customers into meaningful groups.  
The goal is to help businesses identify high-value customers, predict churn, and tailor marketing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **RFM scoring** to evaluate customer behavior.  
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers.  
- Visualize the clusters and interpret insights for decision-making.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (K-means, silhouette score, elbow method)  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter (exploration, visualization, and reporting)  

---

## 📂 Workflow
1. **Data Preparation** – Cleaning and formatting customer transaction data.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.  
3. **Normalization** – Scaling values to improve clustering performance.  
4. **Modeling** – Applying K-means clustering and evaluating with silhouette score.  
5. **Visualization** – Plotting clusters and analyzing customer groups.  

---

## ✅ Key Results
- Identified **4 distinct customer segments**:  
  - **VIP / High Value** – frequent, high spenders.  
  - **Loyal Customers** – moderate spenders, high frequency.  
  - **Occasional Customers** – irregular purchasing patterns.  
  - **At-Risk Customers** – long inactivity, low monetary value.  

- Improved understanding of customer base for **targeted marketing campaigns**.
