# 🍞 Operations Analytics – Bakery Optimization with OR-Tools

## 📄 Project Overview
This project applies **Operations Research techniques** to optimize bakery production.  
Inspired by Akpan (2016), the objective is to **maximize profit and minimize costs** while considering production constraints.  
The project includes extensions to the original model and scenario testing for robustness.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, pandas, matplotlib  
- OR-Tools (Google Optimization Tools)  

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Modeling** – Formulation of original LP problem from Akpan (2016).  
2. **Extension** – Adding additional constraints for realism.  
3. **Scenario Analysis** – Running multiple cases to test the robustness of the model.  
4. **Visualization** – Plotting results for interpretation.  

---

## ✅ Results
- Developed a **linear programming model** with OR-Tools.  
- Achieved optimal allocation of production resources under constraints.  
- Compared base model vs. extended model and tested multiple scenarios.
